        <li>Double Ridge Horn Antenna Design for Microwave X-Band applications</li>
        <p>The double ridge horn antenna is a versatile and efficient antenna that is well suitable for a wide range of microwave applications due to its high performance and reliability. The microwave applications are satellite communication, radar systems and microwave imaging. The antenna consists of a flared horn with two ridges along the inner walls, which creates a more complex electromagnetic field and enhances the radiation pattern. In this Design FR-4 Epoxy Substrate is used because of Good Electrical Properties such as low dielectric constant and low loss tangent. The Ansys HFSS software tool is used to design the double ridge horn antenna in the frequency range 4-8GHz and 8-12GHz to analyse the performance of the antenna comparisons are made with the different set of frequency range.</p>
